## Known Issues

* Empty images cannot be handled by the current model (the error is intentional and thrown when trying to go through matchers, not sure how an empty image should be evaluated and what loss should be returned, our data contain plenty of empty space in a non-empty image anyways, so I'm not going to try and fix that; right now the empty images are dropped when going through the collate function, and when preprocessing empty images are sometimes dropped to improve efficiency. Note that because of this, val and infer images will have a much high proportion of images that are empty, which may or may not be a problem).
* This code is not compatible with the `torch.nn.DataParallel` utilities. This is because when distribution happens within the `DataParallel` module, only `torch.Tensor` objects are treated as mini-batches and can be distributed (`scatter()`ed). This results in errors when the module attempts to split single image onto multiple GPUs and the color dimension is corrupted. `DistributedDataParallel()` have to be used and some sample code is available in [`torchvision/references/detection/train.py`](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/references/detection/train.py).

## TODOs NOW

* [ ] `utils/preprocess_openaitanzania.py` is up and running but obviously GT images need to be inspected
* [ ] w/o any pretraining, inference from a pretrained model produces very good results on a test image (within the COCO dataset), and a reasonable number of predictions. There is a mystery as to why the no. of predictions is consistently 100 for my model and I think that may either be due to failure to train, or be the reason why the model is not training.
